# cs1230-final-project
cs1230 fall23 final project!
For our project we decided to create a peaceful terrarium floating in the sky! The main features we implemented were L-systems, a particle system, billboarding, and a custom water shader. Throughout our scene you'll find small details like textures applied to rocks, refraction on our glass container, and an environment sphere. There are no bugs that we are aware of. 

If you run our program, please use the floating-island branch. We hope you enjoy! <3
